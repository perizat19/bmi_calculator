DOCUMENTATION ON MY CLASSES AND METHODS.
In main.py file I created an application.
In mywindow.py file I created MyWindow class, where I inherited QMainWindow class's __init__ function. Then, there is a function to create a menu bar, where a user can choose 'file' option, that 
provides with such actions as clear (to clear inputs of the user) and exit (to exit from the application) and 'help' option, where he can get an instruction on how to use the application
to calculate his BMI. For these options there are corresponding fuctions, named 'clear_action' and 'help_action'.
'calculate_bmi' function was created to calculate the BMI of the user based on his inputs.
Then, I created weight and height labels and line edits, push button, result and status of bmi labels.

HOW TO RUN MY CODE?
If you want to use my code, you should:
1. Push the run button. You will see my application window.
2. Enter your weight in kg in an appropriate line.
3. Enter your height in m in an appropriate line.
4. Push the green button.
As a result, you will see your BMI and status of your weight.

MENU.
On the top left corner you will see menu bar. If you push 'file', you can use 'clear' or 'exit' actions to creal your inputs or exit.
If you push 'help', you will see an instruction, that explains how to use the BMI calculator', on the screen.
